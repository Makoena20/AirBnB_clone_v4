# AirBnB Clone - Version 4

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This repository is the fourth iteration of the AirBnB clone, where we introduce dynamic web elements and enhance functionality using JavaScript, JQuery, and Flask. This project builds upon the previous versions, integrating more advanced features to create a richer user experience.

## New Contributions

In this version, we have introduced several new features and improvements:

1. **Dynamic Content Loading**: Utilize JQuery to dynamically load content without refreshing the page.
2. **API Integration**: Enhanced interaction with our API to fetch and display data in real-time.
3. **DOM Manipulation**: Added scripts to manipulate the DOM elements based on user interactions.
4. **AJAX Requests**: Implemented GET and POST requests using JQuery Ajax for seamless data communication.
5. **Improved User Interface**: Refined the UI for a better user experience, including updated styles and interactive elements.

## Features

- **Interactive Filters**: Users can filter places dynamically without reloading the page.
- **Real-Time Data**: Data is fetched and displayed in real-time from our backend API.
- **Enhanced UI**: Improved user interface with better design and responsiveness.
- **Flask Integration**: Utilized Flasgger for API documentation and testing.

## Installation

    ```

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Backend logic and API implementation.
- **Flask**: Web framework used to create the web application and API.
- **JQuery**: Used for making AJAX requests and manipulating the DOM.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend structure and styling.
- **Flasgger**: For API documentation.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you should be able to:

- Request your own API and handle the responses.
- Modify HTML element styles dynamically.
- Update HTML element content using JavaScript.
- Manipulate the DOM to reflect changes without reloading the page.
- Make GET and POST requests using JQuery Ajax.
- Bind to DOM and user events to create interactive elements.

## Project Structure

- **api/**: Contains the Flask API.
- **models/**: Contains the data models.
- **web_dynamic/**: Contains the frontend code, including JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- **scripts/**: Contains the JavaScript files for dynamic content and AJAX requests.
